* How do I handle directories for output files?

  You do not have to, since ~bob~ does that for you.

* How do I gracefully stop bob build process?
  Create the file called ~STOP~ in the build directory.

  This will make ~bob~ wait for all currently running processes to finish and
  exit gracefully.
* How do I visualize data dependencies in my workflow?

* What are the allowed shapes of visulaized nodes?
  #+BEGIN_SRC text

  ellipse

  #+END_SRC

* How do I tag a group of file which are not output from a single rule?

  Use tagging rules.

  Tagging rules contain only fields ~tag~ and ~out~.
  They introduce only a name for a group of files.
  Using tagging rules you may mark also input files.

  Example of tagging rule:
  #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  [ [ (out* [ "A.txt" "B.txt" ]) (tag "input") ] ]
  #+END_SRC
